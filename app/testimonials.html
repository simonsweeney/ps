			<p><em>“I attend several conferences each year, mostly in the USA and mostly on the topic of Talent Management, Leadership and Learning. I can honestly say that the Pendulum Summit compared very favourably with the best conferences I have attended in the US. The speaker line-up of high calibre thought-leaders (Irish and International), as well as successful Irish business leaders, was outstanding. The 1-minute audience participation sessions gave visibility and voice to other high profile experts. The "fun stuff" to kick off after each break really created a relaxed atmosphere. Affordable price-point and good value for money. Yes - I would absolutely be interested in attending a similar event in the future and would recommend it to colleagues and friends.”</em><br />

But I have never been at one that was so motivating, so up-lifting, so positive and yet so practical as your conference yesterday. So, all in all, a stunning success. Irish people can be critical and cynical, from time to time. And to keep them satisfied for such a long day was an amazing achievement. We could all feel the positivity hormones bouncing off the four walls! I spoke to a lot of the participants and I heard nothing but the highest praise - for the event...and for you. I just wish I was 30 years younger; I know I could go out and take on the world....and win!”</em><br />
